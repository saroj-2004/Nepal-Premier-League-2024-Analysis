# Nepal Premier League 2024 Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament held in 2024. Using real match data, it explores batting, bowling, fielding, partnerships, wicketkeeping, and match summaries through interactive visualizations and statistical summaries.

A modern, interactive dashboard is also available, allowing users to explore the data visually and intuitively.

- **Bowling Analysis:** Top wicket-takers, economy rates, bowling averages, and four/five-wicket hauls.
- **Fielding Analysis:** Most catches, catch distributions, and fielding impact.
- **Partnership Analysis:** Highest partnerships by runs/wickets, team-wise partnership stats.
- **Wicketkeeping:** Most dismissals, catches, stumpings, and their distributions.
- **Final Match Analysis:** Run progression, runs per over, boundary heatmaps, batsmen contributions, wicket fall timelines, and shot direction frequencies.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Built with Plotly and Streamlit for deep data exploration.
- **Web Dashboard:** Explore the data live at [nepalpremiereleague.streamlit.app](https://nepalpremiereleague.streamlit.app/)
